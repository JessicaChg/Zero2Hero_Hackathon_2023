# Relation-Graph


## What is Relation-Graph

Relation-Graph is a decentralized social graph deployed on BNB Chain. It creates a blockchain-native data layer through SBTs and a standard data format, enabling developers around the world to build decentralized social graphs on blockchain.


Relation-Graph is a social graph that inherits from the Relation Protocol.Any developer can create functions and data types in its social graph layer while allowing users to preserve their social relations and contents on the social network regardless of changes to the application layer.

## The Composition of Social Graph


Relation-Graph forms an on-chain social graph by converting all user behavior into SBT. We use the user's wallet address as their identity, and create an SBT for each action the user takes on a social application, such as building relationships, publishing content, setting names, etc. For efficiency and scalability, we adopt the BNB Chain + Greenfield solution. Token creation and storage is handled by BNBChain, while content and file data are stored and recorded by Greenfield.



## The value of Relation-Graph


### User sovereignty

With a decentralized social graph, users now have more autonomy and control over how their social data should be shared and used. This improves participation and satisfaction.

### Interoperability between social networks

A decentralized social graph can facilitate interoperability between different social networks. With more users sharing and transferring data freely between social networks, we can envision a future where barriers between these networks could be removed, promoting further integration and development. Meanwhile, the increased interoperability enabled by an open standard also encourages innovations, providing better services and user experience. Furthermore, there are many privacy-preserving mechanisms on the market. With this increased interoperability, we can also leverage these technologies to better protect user data.

### Privacy matters

DeSoc solutions today are not immune to privacy issues. A decentralized social graph provides users with better control over their own social network data to preserve their privacy. With user data stored on a decentralized network instead of a centralized one, the chance of data leak is reduced.

### Self-governance for social networks

A decentralized social graph promotes self-governance for social networks. Users in these networks can organize and govern their communities to facilitate a more open and democratic social network environment.

### Data security

A decentralized social graph using blockchain technology to store and manage social network data could provide better security when it comes to safeguarding user data, with the immutability and decentralized control enabled by blockchain technology.

### Democratic decision making

In a decentralized social graph community, users can collectively decide the directions and decisions for the network to move forward. This promotes user engagement and increases network resiliency.

### Composability

For the moment decentralized societies have not taken form. That means social graph infrastructures should be open and have composability to be the pillar underpinning a decentralized future. This is critical for innovations.
Relation-Graph allows this by defining identities and social behaviors in social networks as SBTs, providing data composability between applications and smart contracts and constructing a blockchain-native social graph.

### Scalability

The Relation-Graph allows developers to deploy their own Semantic SBT contracts to expand the horizon of social graphs.

### Developer friendly

Graph database technology is important for developers dealing with traditional social networks. It allows for efficient search and recommendations. With Relation-Graph, social network data can be connected with graph databases with little trouble.
